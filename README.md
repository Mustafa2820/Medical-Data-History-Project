# Medical-Data-History-Project

In this project, I analyzed a medical history data dataset . 4 tables admissions ,patients,doctors,province_names. The goal of the analysis was to provide insights and recommendations to help the Hospital management leaders make informed decisions about managing the hospital. Specifically, I aimed to answer 35 questions related to patients, attending doctor & extra .

1 province_names: Contains information about different provinces.
<br>
2 patients: Stores details about patients, including a foreign key referencing the province they belong to.
<br>
3 doctors: Holds information about doctors and their specializations.
<br>
4 admissions: Tracks details of patient admissions, including the patient, doctor, admission date, discharge date, and diagnosis.
